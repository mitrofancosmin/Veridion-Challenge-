Task
The goal is to consolidate duplicates into a single, enriched entry per product, maximizing available information while ensuring uniqueness.

Context
The dataset contains product details extracted from various web pages using LLMs, resulting in duplicate entries where the same product appears across different sources. Each row represents partial attributes of a product.

Guidelines
Take the time to deeply understand the problem before writing code. Even the most sophisticated solution is ineffective if it solves the wrong problem. Misalignment in problem definition leads to incorrect conclusions and wasted effort.
Thoroughly analyze the dataset to understand each attribute clearly.
There isn’t always a single solution to this problem. Some decisions may be neither strictly right nor wrong, but they should be supported by as many relevant factors as possible.
It’s essential to document your decisions and the reasoning behind them.
From a tech stack perspective, you can use any programming language, toolset or libraries you’re comfortable with or find necessary, especially if you know it would be a better option or a more interesting one (we generally prefer Scala, Java, Python).
At Veridion, we run similar algorithms on billions of records. While your solution doesn’t need to scale to that level, it would be impressive if it does. For now, however, what matters most is your approach to solving the problem—if your solution is exceptional for the given dataset, we trust that you can scale it effectively using the right tools.
